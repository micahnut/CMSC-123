MPA1 Include Me
Input: A c/c++ source file
Output: A file
Instructions:

A c/c++ source file normally starts with the include preprocessor directive.
This file is "inserted” to the c/c++ source file making the functions in the included file visible/accessible to the source file.
An "included” file may, of course, contain include preprocessor directives.
The goal is simply to literally insert the contents of the included files in the c/c++ source file, replacing the preprocessor directives in the correct order.
NOTE: Upload/Submit only the source file. There are sample files uploaded in this assignment. For simplicity, all the header files contain function declarations/prototypes only.
